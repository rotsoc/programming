### Python Programming Exercises

## Exercise 1

Question:

Write a program to compute 1/2+2/3+3/4+...+n/n+1 with a given n input by console (n>0).

Example:
If the following n is given as input to the program:

5

Then, the output of the program should be:

3.55

In case of input data being supplied to the question, it should be assumed to be a console input.

Hints:
Use float() to convert an integer to a float

## Exercise 2

Task 1:

Check whether
x= 2.3
is a zero of the function:
f(x) = x^2+ 0.25xâˆ’5
(Evaluate the right-hand side expression and check if the result is near zero.)

Task 2:

Use the command ```range``` and a list comprehension to generate a list with 100
equidistantly spaced values between 0 and 1.

Task 3:

Set up a list ```yplot``` which contains the values ```arctan(x)``` for all the ```x``` in ```xplot```.
